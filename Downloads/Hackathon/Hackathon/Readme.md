Description: Design a 3rd party tool that can act as a failover and load re-balancing engine for a cluster of docker nodes

Solution: The solution is to design a modular system of handling failover code separately and re-balancing engine separately; while still the containers being initiated are able to be moved from each module to the other. 
 - Failover: The failover module will keep track of all the nodes(polling via Virtual-Box) and the containers that each node is running. In case of a node failure, the containers that were running are restarted on other nodes based on their health factor. A node is said to be 'healthy' if it is available and its load is below the threshold. 

 - Re-balancing engine: The re-balancing engine will check node stats as a pre-condition before running a container. In case if the node is not healthy (very high load interms of CPU & RAM usage) one of the container is moved to a healty(less loaded) node. For a schdeuled time the health check of all available nodes is checked by the re-balancing engine. If any node is noticed to be over-loaded then its containers are moved to other nodes untill this node is returned to normal state.

Solution-Implementation: Docker-client java API & Virtual-Box java API was used to implement the solution.

Execution: The solution is implemented to provide a Command-Line Interface which will first list all the available nodes. The user selects one of the node to run the images and the node re-balancer will check if the selected node is healthy. If the image uses more system resources on that node, then the re-balancer will automatically stop the container on which the image is running and the same image is initiated on lesser loaded node.
